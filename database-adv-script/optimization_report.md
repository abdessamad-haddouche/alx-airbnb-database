# Query Optimization Report

The initial query retrieves comprehensive booking information, including:

- User details  
- Property information  
- Payment data  
- Property reviews  

While the query returns complete and rich data, it suffers from several performance issues:
- Excessive table joins increase complexity and execution time.
- Lack of proper indexing leads to full table scans.
- No filtering or pagination, resulting in large result sets.
- Redundant or unnecessary columns may be retrieved.
- Missing join conditions may lead to Cartesian products or inflated row counts.

These factors collectively contribute to suboptimal performance, particularly under heavy load or large dataset conditions.
